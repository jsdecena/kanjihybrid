		My fellow 米mericans, 総upreme 盟llied 帥ommander 将eneral MacArthur, and 盟llied representatives on the 艦attleship Missouri in Tokyo 湾ay:

		The 想houghts and 望opes of 全ll 米merica, 実ndeed of 全ll the civilized 世orld, are 央entered 晩onight on the 艦attleship Missouri. There on that 小mall 個iece of 米merican 土oil 碇nchored in Tokyo 港arbor the Japanese have just 公fficially laid-down 彼heir 武rms. 彼hey have 署igned terms of unconditional 諦urrender.

		四our 年ears 前go, the 想houghts and 恐ears of the 全hole civilized 世orld were 央entered on 別nother 個iece of 米merican 土oil, 珠earl 港arbor. The 強ighty 脅hreat to civilization 何hich 初egan 有here-is 今ow laid at 休est. It was a 永ong 路oad to Tokyo, and a 血loody one.

		We shall 不ot 忘orget 珠earl 港arbor. The Japanese 軍ilitarists will 不ot 忘orget the U.S.S. Missouri.

		The 悪vil done by the Japanese 戦ar lords can 不ever be 修epaired or 忘orgotten. But 彼heir 力ower to 破estroy and 殺ill has been 取aken from 彼hem. 彼heir 軍rmies and 何hat is 残eft of 彼heir Navy are 今ow impotent.

		To 全ll of us there comes 初irst a 覚ense of 謝ratitude to Almighty-God 誰ho sustained us and 我ur 盟llies in the 暗ark 日ays of 重rave 危anger, 誰ho made us to 培row from 劣eakness into the 強trongest 戦ighting 軍orce in 史istory, and 誰ho has 今ow 覧een us 超vercome the 軍orces of tyranny that 求ought to 破estroy 彼is civilization.

		神od 与rant that in 我ur 誇ride of 今his 時our, we may 不ot 忘orget the 難ard tasks that are still 前efore us; that we may 寄pproach these with the 同ame 勇ourage, zeal, and 耐atience with 何hich we 向aced the 試rials and 困roblems of the past 四our 年ears.

		我ur 初irst 意houghts, of-course -- 意houghts of 謝ratefulness and 深eep obligation -- go out to 彼hose of 我ur 愛oved ones 誰ho have been 殺illed or maimed in this 凄errible 戦ar. On 地and and 海ea and in the 空ir, 米merican 男en and 婦omen have 捧iven 彼heir 命ives so that 今his 日ay of 最ltimate 勝ictory might come and 確ssure the survival of a civilized 世orld. No 勝ictory can make good 彼heir 喪oss.

		We 思hink of 彼hose 誰hom 死eath in this 戦ar has 傷urt, 取aking from 彼hem 父athers, 夫usbands, 息ons, 兄rothers, and 妹isters 誰hom 彼hey 愛oved. No 勝ictory can bring back the 顔aces 彼hey 永ong to 覧ee.

		只nly the 知nowledge that the 勝ictory, 何hich these 犠acrifices have made 可ossible, will-be 智isely 使sed can 与ive 彼hem 何ny 慰omfort. It is 我ur 責esponsibility – 我urs, the 命iving – to 覧ee to it that this 勝ictory shall be a 碑onument 価orthy of the 死ead 誰ho 死ied to 勝in it. 
		[audio gap, content uncertain]

		全ll the millions of 男en and 婦omen in 我ur 軍rmed-forces and 商erchant 海arine all-over the 世orld 誰ho, 後fter 年ears of 犠acrifice and 難ardship and 危eril, have been spared by Providence from 痛arm.

		We 思hink of 全ll the 男en and 婦omen and 児hildren 誰ho 間uring these 年ears have carried on at 宅ome, in 寂onesomeness and 憂nxiety and 恐ear.

		我ur 意houghts go out to the millions of 米merican 労orkers and 商usiness 男en, to 我ur 農armers and 鉱iners, to 全ll 彼hose 誰ho have 建uilt up this 国ountry’s 戦ighting 強trength, and 誰ho have 輸hipped to 我ur 盟llies the 資eans to 抗esist and 超vercome the 敵nemy.

		我ur 意houghts go out to 我ur 官ivil-servants and to the 千housands of 米mericans 誰ho, at 私ersonal 犠acrifice, have come-to 働erve in 我ur 政overnment 間uring these 試rying 年ears, to the 員embers of the Selective Service-boards and ration boards, to the civilian 守efense and 赤ed 十ross 労orkers, to the 男en and 婦omen in the USO, and in the 興ntertainment 世orld, to 全ll 彼hose 誰ho have 助elped in this 協ooperative 戦truggle to 保reserve liberty and decency in the 世orld.

		We 思hink of 我ur 霊eparted gallant 導eader, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 護efender of democracy, 築rchitect of 世orld 和eace and 協ooperation.

		And 我ur 意houghts go out to 我ur gallant 盟llies in this 戦ar, to 彼hose 誰ho 抗esisted the invaders, to 彼hose 誰ho were 不ot 強trong enough to hold out, but 誰ho, nevertheless, kept the 火ires of 抗esistance 生live 内ithin the 霊ouls of 彼heir 民eople, to 彼hose 誰ho 起tood-up 対gainst great odds and held the 線ine, 迄ntil the United Nations 共ogether were 可ble to 与upply the 武rms and the 男en with 何hich to 超vercome the 軍orces of 悪vil.

		This is a 勝ictory of more-than arms 独lone. This is a 勝ictory of liberty over tyranny.

		From 我ur 戦ar plants 回olled the tanks and planes 何hich 爆lasted 彼heir way to the 央eart of 我ur 敵nemies. From 我ur shipyards 跳prang the 艦hips 何hich 橋ridged 全ll the 海ceans of the 世orld for 我ur 武eapons and 給upplies. From 我ur 農arms came the 飯ood and 維iber for 我ur 軍rmies and navies and for 我ur 盟llies in 全ll the 角orners of the Earth. From 我ur mines and factories came the 生aw 料aterials and the 完inished 品roducts 何hich 与ave us the 器quipment to 超vercome 我ur 敵nemies.

		But back of it 全ll were the will and 精pirit and 決etermination of a free 民eople 誰ho 知now 何hat freedom is, and 誰ho 知now that it is 価orth 何hatever 額rice 彼hey had to 払ay to 保reserve it.
		It was the 精pirit of liberty 何hich 与ave us 我ur 軍rmed 強trength and 何hich made 我ur 男en invincible in 戦attle. We 今ow 知now that that 精pirit of liberty, the freedom of the individual, and the 私ersonal 敬ignity of 男an, are the 強trongest, and 硬oughest, and 最ost 耐nduring 軍orces in 全ll the 世orld.

		And so on V-J 日ay we 取ake -- make -- 取ake 再enewed 信aith and 誇ride in 我ur 自wn way of 暮ife. We have had 我ur 日ay of 喜ejoicing over this 勝ictory. We have had 我ur 日ay of 祈rayer and 忠evotion. 今ow let us set aside V-J 日ay as one of 再enewed consecration to the 理rinciples 何hich have made us the 強trongest 国ation on Earth and 何hich, in this 戦ar, we have striven so 強ightily to 保reserve.

		Those 理rinciples 与rovide the 信aith, the 望ope, and the opportunity 何hich 助elp 男en to 改mprove 彼hem 自elves and 彼heir lot. Liberty does 不ot make 全ll 男en 完erfect 不or 全ll 社ociety 保ecure. But it has 与rovided more 固olid 歩rogress and 喜appiness and decency for more 民eople than 何ny 他ther 哲hilosophy of 政overnment in 史istory. And 今his 日ay has 示hown 再gain that it 与rovides the 最reatest 強trength and the 最reatest 力ower 何hich 男an has ever 届eached.

		We 知now that 下nder it we can 向eet the 難ard 困roblems of 和eace 何hich have come upon us. A free 民eople with free 盟llies, 誰ho can develop an atomic bomb, can 使se the 同ame 技kill and 力nergy and 決etermination to 超vercome 全ll the 難ifficulties 先head.

		勝ictory 頻lways has its 負urdens, and its 責esponsibilities, 及s-well as its 喜ejoicing.

		But we 向ace the 将uture and 全ll its 危angers with great 信onfidence and great 望ope. 米merica can 建uild for 自tself a 将uture of 雇mployment and 保ecurity. 共ogether with the United Nations, it can 建uild a 世orld of 和eace founded-on justice, fair 契ealing, and 許olerance.

		As President of the United-States, I 宣roclaim Sunday, September the 二econd, 1945, to be V-J 日ay -- the 日ay of 式ormal 諦urrender of Japan. It is 未ot-yet the 日ay for the 式ormal 宣roclamation of the 終nd of the 戦ar 不or of the cessation of 憎ostilities. But it is a 日ay 何hich we 米mericans shall 頻lways 憶emember as a 日ay of retribution -- as we 憶emember that 他ther 日ay, the 日ay of infamy.

		From 今his 日ay we 動ove 進orward. We 動ove 向oward a 新ew 紀ra of 保ecurity at 宅ome. With the 他ther United Nations we 動ove 向oward a 新ew and 良etter 世orld of 協ooperation, of 和eace, and international good will.

		God’s 助elp has 連rought us to 今his 日ay of 勝ictory. With 彼is 助elp we will 叶ttain that 和eace and 盛rosperity for 我ur 自elves
